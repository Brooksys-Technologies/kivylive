Kivy Live
===========

Description:
-------------
Simply put, this little app is developed to speedup the design/development of (kivy)[https://www.kivy.org] applications by allowing you to create
the frontend of your app while simulteneously viewing your results.
\
\
This project started when I simply got tired of having to code, go_to_the_terminal and run the whole app when in reality, Im simply just designing the app in the first place.
As such, I wanted a way to be able to see where Im at in the design while designing the app hence where this program came in.

## Credits

Most of the code in this app is taken from the (kivy)[https://www.kivy.org] examples folder, so thank you guys for that.

## Installation

In the root of this project is a directory titled `releases`. In that folder you can find two files:
\
* `kivylive.exe` - This is the windows standalone program for `kivylive`. Download that if you are on windows then simply double
click to fire it up. **No Installation Required**
* `kivylive.tar.gz` - This is the linux version of the program, compiled using `Ubuntu 18.04`. Download the archive and extract it.
\
You should get a folder titled `kivylive`
\
`cd` into that folder and simply run `./install.sh`
\
That's it, now you can launch the program from your Application list.

TODO
----
* Support Python files
* Allow Duplicate Files in different locations
* Add a visual builder
* Create binaries for macOS
* Create android app
* think of more things to add ;)
